*** INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE APP USING XAMPP ***

    1) Make sure to have XAMPP and Node.js installed (note you can also setup your db without 
        XAMPP, directly with MySQL and an interface of your choice, such as Workbench).

    2) Clone the remote repo, two main ways:
        (a) Extracting the zip file on your chosen directory
        (b) Or through the command line, from your chosen directory execute: 
            git clone https://github.com/soen341ThinkVision/-ThinkVision-SOEN341_Project_F24-.git

    3) Open the folder in your editor (Visual Studio Code has been mainly used so far).

    4) Open XAMPP and start MySQL and Apache.

    5) In XAMPP, open the MySQL interface and create a database called "pas".
        - NOTE: make sure you have not setup a password to access your localhost MySQL server.

    6) In the command line, cd into the "app" directory, which contains the program, and install 
        the necessary packages by running the command: npm install

        *IMPORTANT!* If this step fails, try to reconfigure the directory by doing the following:
            - Copy the directory path, that is, right click the "app" folder and click 'copy path',
            - Then in the command line, run: Set-Location <copied path>

    7) To launch the server, execute from the command line either npm start or node server.js
        - If the connection is successful the app should log to console: 
            "Server running on port 5002" and "MySQL database connected"

    8) Then to use the app enter "localhost:5002" in your browser (currently tested on firefox, 
        chrome, and safari).

*** IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS ***

    - Whenever the server is reloaded, the database is cleared and the tables are reset, if you
        want to disable that while testing new features, just comment out lines 44-61 of server.js,
        but then you must set up the teachers and students table yourself in your local database.

    - When a professor user uploads a .csv file with the course roster, the file must be formatted 
        as follows: first column labeled "ID" and second column labeled "Name".
        - See test.csv for a simple example.

    - Note that during the instructor's team selection, instructors have the option to auto-assign 
        all students given an input of students per team, but they can also manually assign 
        students by directly editing the "Team" column.
